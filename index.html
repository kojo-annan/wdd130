            <p>I'm Paa Kojo and I love watching anime on my free times, and I also enjoy quiet times a lot. I am dark in color, the 3rd born to my parents and also the last one, I live in Kojokrom under Sekondi District and I am currently enrolling in Takoradi Technical University, offering Electrical/Electronic Engineering and Brigham Young University, offering Web Development. I served my mission in Nigeria Owerri Mission.Fante is my native language and probably one of the best and flexible language in Ghana.I enjoy walking to alot of places instead of using transport means because I believe I am more active and healthy when i walk more.</p>
